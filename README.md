### Site Creation Path Project Board

In addition to User Stories and Tasks Project board I also created a Site Creation Path Board Used Github's Project board again to plan the projects creation path.

### Different Screen Size

The site is optimized for all screen sizes and tested with a Macbook Pro 13" and iPhone 13 Pro.
I use media queries to make everything look and feel good on mobile devices.

### Issues found during site development and their Solutions

1. When adding the localhost as an ALLOWEDHOST in the settings page, I continued to receive an Django error indicating the host needed to be added to the allowed host settings.

    * As this was being developed locally in VS Code. I tried editing the hosts file via -

      ```bash
      sudo nano /private/etc/hosts
      ```

      Saving the changes by pressing ```ctrl + O```, then exiting by pressing ```ctrl + X```  

    This error continues - but if ```http://localhost:8000/``` or ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/``` are used in the address bar the site works, just not directly from the link in the output message in the terminal.

1. Next issue to arise

## Deployment

1. On the home screen click on create new app button
2. Enter a name for the project and select your region to the correct region
3. On the next screen select settings
4. Go to config vars and click reveal config vars
5. Switch to the program file and where you are keeping your credentials copy these and then on Heroku enter a name for the key and paste the code into the config vars value box and click add
6. Now scroll down to buildPacks and click add build packs
7. First select python and click save changes
8. Click back into build packs and choose node.js and click save again
9. Ensure that the Python build pack is at the top of the list you are able to drag and drop if you need to rearrange
10. Now select deploy
11. From the deployment method select GitHub
12. Then click on connect to Github button that appears
13. Click into the search box and search for the project name
14. Once located select connect
15. Then click deploy branch, this will then be shown in the box below
16. You can the click view to show the app in a browser

The program is set to be deployed automatically after each push from gitpod.

I also set up a Postgres database with Heroku.

1. Click on Resources in your Heroku app.
2. In the add-ons field search for Heroku Postgres and press submit.
